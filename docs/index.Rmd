# Objectives

The aim of this project is to use the GRROE Lab's Master Intake Data for
Red Mangroves to determine:

1\. How the red mangrove collection sites have changed from 2021 to
2024?

2\. Around what time of the year are the red mangroves reproducing most?

3\. How has reproduction changed over time?

4\. Map the Collection Sites of Red Mangroves

```{=html}
<!--**make df with site and lat long and then join by site (done)
** when are most mangs collected? total over the 4 years (september) 
\*\*add how many people collected mangs (for future)

**total number of mangs collected across all sites in a certain month (done)
** average mangroves per site based on how many sites you went to in each month (done) 
\*\*number of total props divided by number of unique collection dates across all months for each site (done)-->

# Preparing Data {.tabset}

## Data Set-up

Load the necessary libraries anf functions:

1.  tidyverse

2.  dplyr

3.  ggplot2

4.  lubridate

5.  writexl

6.  split_collection_date_func.R

```{r Loading libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
source("split_collection_date_func.R")
library(writexl)
```

<br>

The first step is to import the CSV for the red mangrove intake data as
of November 20th, 2024 and a CSV I made with the simplified collection
sites coordinates.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

RHMA_Intake<- read_csv("RHMA_Master_Nursery_Intake_Data.csv")
RHMA_Sites<- read_csv("RHMA_Sites.csv")
```

## Data Cleaning

Then, begin performing QA/QC on the data by removing the spaces from the
column headers.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remove spaces from column names
colnames(RHMA_Intake) <- gsub(" ", "", colnames(RHMA_Intake))
# #remove the extra columns
# RHMA_Intake<-RHMA_Intake%>%
#   select(-(21:29))
```

It's time to clean the data by formatting the dates to look the same for
Collection Date and Date Planted. Create columns that separate the
Collection Date column into Year, Month and Day.

```{r}
unique(RHMA_Intake$CollectionSite)
#  [1] "Oasis Cove"        "Compass Pt."       "Compass Point"     "CP"                "Marina"            "AL"               
#  [7] "BB-HB"             "SR_HB"             "PB"                "SR"                "AB"                "OC"               
# [13] "SR - MARINA"       "SALT RIVER MARINA" "ALTONA"            "SRBB"              "BB"                "MB"               
# [19] "STEER ECOTOURS"    "MAGENS BAY"        "N/A"               NA                  "perseverance"      "Perseverance"     
# [25] "Range Cay"         "STEER"             "Annaberg"          "Salt River"        "Preserverance"     "Brewers"          
# [31] "Perserverance"     "Vessup"            "Mandahl"  


#want all the site IDs to say the name of the site

# RHMA_Intake<-RHMA_Intake%>%
#   mutate(CollectionSite=recode(CollectionSite,
#     "Compass Pt."= "Compass Point",

#     "MB"= "Mandahl Bay",
#     "STEER ECOTOURS"= "STEER Ecotours",
#     "MAGENS BAY"= "Magens Bay",
#     "N/A"= "NA",
#     "NA "= "NA",
#     "perseverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
#     "Preserverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
#     "Perserverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
#     "Perseverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
#     "Brewers"= "Brewers Bay",
#     "Vessup"= "Vessup Bay",
#     "Mandahl"= "Mandahl Bay"))

#this version is to combine all the Salt River and STEER options
RHMA_Intake<-RHMA_Intake%>%
  mutate(CollectionSite=recode(CollectionSite,
    "Compass Pt."= "Compass Point",
    "CP"= "Compass Point",
    "AL"= "Altona Lagoon",
    "SR_HB"= "Salt River",
    "BB-HB"= "Salt River",
    "PB"= "Perseverance Bay",
    "SR"= "Salt River",
    "AB"= "Annaberg Bay",
    "Annaberg"= "Annaberg Bay",
    "OC"= "Oasis Cove",
    "SR - MARINA"= "Salt River",
    "SALT RIVER MARINA"= "Salt River",
    "Marina"= "Salt River",
    "ALTONA"= "Altona Lagoon",
    "SRBB"= "Salt River",
    "BB"= "Brewers Bay",
    "MB"= "Mandahl Bay",
    "STEER ECOTOURS"= "STEER",
    "MAGENS BAY"= "Magens Bay",
    "N/A"= "NA",
    "NA "= "NA",
    "perseverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
    "Preserverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
    "Perserverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
    "Perseverance"= "Perseverance Bay",
    "Brewers"= "Brewers Bay",
    "Vessup"= "Vessup Bay",
    "Mandahl"= "Mandahl Bay"))

print(unique(RHMA_Intake$CollectionSite))
```

By combining these different variations into a combined collection site,
it makes it easier to visualize the data. I then have to further clean
the data by removing any Collection Sites that were 'NA'.

```{r}
#remove props from NA sites
RHMA_Intake<-RHMA_Intake%>%
  filter(!(CollectionSite=="NA"))

#remove all rows where collection site isn't recorded (NA in dataframe)
RHMA_Intake<-RHMA_Intake%>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionSite))
  
#check to make sure all sites have a collection site
RHMA_Intakecheck<-RHMA_Intake%>%
  filter(CollectionSite==NA|CollectionSite=="NA")

print(unique(RHMA_Intake$CollectionSite))

# RHMA_Filtered <- RHMA_Intake %>%
#   filter(CollectionDate != "Jan-31") %>%  # Filter out rows where CollectionDate is "1/31"
#   filter(!is.na(CollectionDate))          # Filter out rows where CollectionDate is NA
# 
# #double check the dates
# unique(RHMA_Intake$CollectionDate)
```

<br>

The next step is to print the unique collection dates to see what needs
to be fixed.

```{r}
print(unique(RHMA_Intake$CollectionDate))
```

After looking at the CollectionDate column and finding a particularly
early date, the next step is to change 19/09/2002 to 19/09/2023 after
verifying the raw data and the fact that this collection only began in
2021.

```{r}
# Change "19/09/2002" to "19/09/2023"
RHMA_Intake$CollectionDate <- sub("19/09/2002", "19/09/2023", RHMA_Intake$CollectionDate)
```

I then made the Collection Date to be one format and checked to see if
there were any dates that failed this section.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Use parse_date_time to handle multiple formats
RHMA_Filtered <- RHMA_Intake %>%
  mutate(CollectionDateParsed = parse_date_time(CollectionDate, 
    orders = c("mdy", "dmy", "ymd"),  # Specify formats: month-day-year and day-month-year
    quiet = TRUE               # Suppress warnings for failed parses
  ))

# Check for any parsing errors
failed_parses <- RHMA_Filtered %>%
  filter(is.na(CollectionDateParsed)) %>%
  select(CollectionDate)

# Print problematic entries if any
if (nrow(failed_parses) > 0) {
  print("Failed to parse the following dates:")
  print(unique(failed_parses$CollectionDate))
} else {
  print("All dates parsed successfully.")
}

```

I created a function to help me split my newly created
CollectionDateParsed column into Collection Year, Collection Month and
Collection Day.

```{r message=FALSE}

# Apply the split_collection_date function to Collection Date and create new columns
RHMA_Filtered2 <- RHMA_Filtered %>%
  mutate(
    `CollectionYear` = sapply(`CollectionDateParsed`, function(x) split_collection_date(x)[1]),
    `CollectionMonth` = sapply(`CollectionDateParsed`, function(x) split_collection_date(x)[2]),
    `CollectionDay` = sapply(`CollectionDateParsed`, function(x) split_collection_date(x)[3])
  )

#Join the sites df and the cleaned data
RHMA_Coords= merge(x= RHMA_Filtered2, y= RHMA_Sites, by= "CollectionSite")

#Export the filtered dataset to use in Arc GIS Pro to make the maps
write.csv(RHMA_Coords, "Filtered_RHMA_Intake.csv")
# write_xlsx(RHMA_Coords, "Filtered_RHMA_Intake.xlsx")
```

Now, I have the cleaned and filtered data that I exported and used to
make my maps in Arc Gis Pro.

# Answering Questions {.tabset}

## Question 1

> How have the red mangrove collection sites have changed from 2021 to
> 2024?

<br>

```{r message=FALSE}
# Group by Year and Collection Site, then count entries
RHMA_collection_summary <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionSite) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionYear))%>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')
```

<!--Create a graph of the RHMA collection summary -->

```{r}
# Create a plot to visualize changes in collection sites over the years
ggplot(RHMA_collection_summary, aes(x = CollectionYear, y = Count, fill = CollectionSite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Changes in RHMA Collection Sites Across Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Collections") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This graph shows the increase in the number of red mangrove collections
from 2021 to 2024. It shows that the most collections were made from
Perseverance Bay in 2024.

<br>

```{r message=FALSE}
# Group by Year and Collection Site, then count entries
RHMA_collection_monthly <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, CollectionSite) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionMonth))%>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')
```

## Question 2

> Around what time of the year are the red mangroves reproducing most?

This question is difficult to answer with the current data. I would need
data that has the number of collectors to have an effort factor, and we
would have needed to have been going to collect mangroves at each site
each month to determine whether more mangrove collection is because of
effort or there actually being more mangroves at each site.

<!--In 2021, most red mangroves were collected in May-->

<br>

<br>

> The question I asked instead is what is the total number of red
> mangroves collected across all sites in a certain month

<br>

```{r}
# Group by Year and Collection Site, then count entries
RHMA_total_collection_monthly <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, CollectionSite) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionMonth))%>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

write.csv(RHMA_total_collection_monthly, "total_collection_monthly.csv")

# Create a plot to visualize changes in collection sites monthly over the years 
ggplot(RHMA_collection_monthly, aes(x = CollectionMonth, y = Count)) +   
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", fill = "lightblue", just= 0.5) +   
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Collections") + 
  ggtitle("Total RHMA Collection Across Months")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Use month abbreviations for x-axis labels   
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This bar graph shows that most mangroves were collected in September,
followed by February and January. This corresponds with having more lab
interns to help with collections.

<br>

```{r}
# Step 3: Find the Month with the Maximum Collection
max_collection <- RHMA_collection_monthly %>%
  group_by(CollectionMonth) %>%
  summarise(TotalCount = sum(Count), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalCount)) %>%
  slice(1)  # Get the month with the highest total count

# Convert numeric months to month abbreviations
max_collection$CollectionMonth <- month.abb[as.numeric(max_collection$CollectionMonth)]

# Print results
print("Month with Highest Red Mangrove Collections:")
print(max_collection)
```

<br>

```{r}
# Step 4: Find the Year with Maximum Collections
yearly_summary <- RHMA_collection_monthly %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear) %>%
  summarise(TotalCount = sum(Count), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalCount))

# Identify the year with the highest total collections
highest_year <- yearly_summary %>%
  slice(1)  # Get the first row (year with highest total count)

# Print results
cat("Year with Highest Red Mangrove Collections:\n")
print(highest_year)
```

<br>

```{r}
# Step 5: Identify the Month with Maximum Collections for Each Year
monthly_max_per_year <- RHMA_collection_monthly %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear) %>%
  filter(Count == max(Count)) %>%  # Filter months where Count is maximum for each year
  select(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, Count)

# Convert numeric months to month abbreviations
monthly_max_per_year$CollectionMonth <- month.abb[as.numeric(monthly_max_per_year$CollectionMonth)]

# Print results for months with maximum collections per year
cat("\n Month with Highest Collections for Each Year:\n")
print(monthly_max_per_year)
```

<br>

<!--Create a graph of the RHMA collection summary-->

```{r}
# Create a plot to visualize changes in collection sites monthly over the years by sites 
ggplot(RHMA_collection_monthly, aes(x = CollectionMonth, y = Count, fill = CollectionSite)) +   
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +   
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Collections") +   
  ggtitle("RHMA Collection Across Sites and Months")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Use month abbreviations for x-axis labels   
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Perseverance Bay accounted for most of the RHMA collections in
September, February and January.

## Question 3

> How has the number of red mangroves collected changed overtime?

<br>

I worked through a for loop to display the month that had the most RHMA
collections in each year.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Loop through each row in monthly_max_per_year 
for (i in 1:nrow(monthly_max_per_year)) {   
  # Convert CollectionYear to integer if it's not already   
  year <- as.integer(monthly_max_per_year$CollectionYear[i])      
  # Convert CollectionMonth to character if it's a numeric value   
  month <- as.character(monthly_max_per_year$CollectionMonth[i])    
  # Count should be numeric; ensure it's treated correctly   
  count <- monthly_max_per_year$Count[i]      
  # Print using sprintf with correct formats   
  cat(sprintf("Year: %d, Month: %s, Count: %d\n", year, month, count)) }
```

<br>

```{r}
# Create a plot to visualize changes in collection sites across months 
ggplot(RHMA_collection_monthly, aes(x = factor(CollectionMonth, sprintf("%02d", 1:12)), y = Count, fill = CollectionSite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +   
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Collections") +
  ggtitle("Number of Red Mangroves Collected by Month Across Years")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Use month abbreviations for x-axis labels   
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +   
  facet_wrap(~ CollectionYear)  # Optional: Create separate plots for each year
```

<!--**average mangroves per site based on how many sites you went to in each month create code that finds the number of unique collection dates and then calculate how many collections were done on each date based on what was intaken.-->

<br>

> How did total number of collection dates change over the years? Did we
> collect more or less?

| Collection Year | Number of Collections | Total Number of Mangroves Collected | Average Mangs Per Collection |
|:---------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
|      2021       |           2           |                 393                 |         393/2= \~197         |
|      2022       |           7           |                 147                 |          147/7 = 21          |
|      2023       |          43           |                2221                 |        2221/43 = \~52        |
|      2024       |          26           |                2031                 |        2031/26 = \~78        |

: Number of RHMA Collections by Year

<br>

The next step is to show the unique collection dates of RHMA mangroves
and how many were collected each time and at what sites.

<!--This code shows the unique collection dates of RHMA mangroves and how many were collected each time and at what sites.-->

```{r message=TRUE}
# Group by Year and Collection Site, then count entries
RHMA_total_collections_by_date <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, CollectionSite, CollectionDateParsed) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionMonth))%>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionDateParsed))%>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

#View the RHMA_total_collections_by_date
print(RHMA_total_collections_by_date)
```

<br>

Then, the average collections are displayed in a bar graph.

<!--This code shows the average number of RHMA collections that were done across the various years regardless of site-->

```{r}
# Group by Year and Collection Month, then count and average the entries
RHMA_average_collections_by_date <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, CollectionSite, CollectionDateParsed) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionMonth))%>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionDateParsed))%>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')%>%
  group_by(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth)%>%
  summarise(AverageCollectionsPerMonth = mean(Count), .groups = 'drop')

#View the RHMA_average_collections_by_date
print(RHMA_average_collections_by_date)

# Create a plot to visualize average collections by year and month
ggplot(RHMA_average_collections_by_date, aes(x = factor(paste(CollectionYear, CollectionMonth, sep = "-")), y = AverageCollectionsPerMonth)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Year-Month", y = "Average Number of Collections") +
  ggtitle("Average Number of RHMA Collections by Month Across Years") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Question 4

> What is the number of total propagules divided by the number of unique
> collection dates across all months for each site?

<br>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Process the data to calculate total props and unique collection dates per site
results <- RHMA_Filtered2 %>%
  group_by(CollectionSite, CollectionYear) %>%
  filter(!is.na(CollectionMonth))%>%
  summarise(
    TotalProps = sum(n_distinct(TagID), na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum of distinct TagIDs as a proxy for total props
    UniqueCollectionDates = n_distinct(CollectionDateParsed),  # Count unique collection dates
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  mutate(Ratio = TotalProps / UniqueCollectionDates)  # Calculate ratio of total props to unique dates

# View the results
#print(results)

write.csv(results, "Prop_Ratio_Across_Sites.csv")

# Create a plot to visualize the ratio of total props to unique collection dates by month
ggplot(results, aes(x = CollectionSite, y = Ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Collection Site", y = "Ratio of Total Props to Unique Collection Dates") +
  ggtitle("Ratio of Total Props Divided by Unique Collection Dates Across Sites") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")  # Optional: Use a color palette for better aesthetics
```

<br>

I then wanted to graph the same data but have it split into years.

<br>

```{r}
# Create a plot to visualize the ratio of total props to unique collection dates facet_wrapped by Collection Year
ggplot(results, aes(x = CollectionSite, y = Ratio, fill = CollectionSite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Collection Site", y = "Ratio of Total Props to Unique Collection Dates") +
  ggtitle("Ratio of Total Props Divided by Unique Collection Dates Across Sites and Years") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") + # Optional: Use a color palette for better aesthetics
  facet_wrap(~ CollectionYear)
```

## Future Arc GIS Pro Steps

> To create a map of red mangrove species proportion: pie chart with

> I'd then filter by year and graph by month and site.

I struggled to make charts in Arc GIS Pro but have the data I'd need to
reopen this project and complete it.
